# InkScapeBoxMaker - For InkScape 1.2+
This is an inkscape extension to support various Laser Cut Box Layouts.

Currently it supports three types of boxes
 - just an open box (with bottom, left, right, front, and back side, but no top cover)
 - a box with a top cover that can be opened by a hinge
 - a shelf box with contained boxes

Major options are
 - box width
 - box height
 - box depth
 - thickness of panel
 
 - units (mm or cm, inch, px) (currently only mm tested)
 
 
This extension has some functional overlap with the "laser Cut Box"-Extension. However instead of supporting only closed boxes, this extension supports also open boxes and hinged boxes.
